# AUTO-DATASET-FUEL-EFFICIENCY-ANALYSIS
Gemini said The Auto dataset (commonly found in the ISLR or StatLib libraries) is a classic benchmark for regression analysis. It allows us to quantify how physical attributes of a vehicle specifically horsepower, weight, and displacement (engine size)predict its fuel efficiency, measured in Miles Per Gallon (MPG).
